This is the project for my bachelor's. 

It is a book tracker web application built with the technologies react, nodejs, express, mongodb, Google Books API and Tesseract OCR. It allows users to search and add books to their library via Google Books API. The users can also make use of a webcam or a phone's camera to extract the title from a book, search for it and add it to their book tracker.
